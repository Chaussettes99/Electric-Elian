A basic yet readable Elian font in monospaced-bitmap and resizable-truetype formats. Initial design for characters are by Koumakan for their [Dwarf Fortress tileset](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169671.0). I simply used [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) to recreate the font as best I can.

Elian Script is a writing system that promotes creativity when drawing it's characters. It's very quick to pick up and [its website](https://www.ccelian.com/concepca.html) provides a quick rundown on how it works. It's basically reading a tic-tac-toe board.

Only the standard latin alphabet is included at the moment, along with numbers 1-9 and commonly used glyphs like "%", "@", and "&". It should be enough for common tasks.
