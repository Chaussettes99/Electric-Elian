A basic yet readable Elian truetype font. Initial design for characters made by Koumakan in their (Dwarf Fortress tileset)[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169671.0]. I simply used (FontForge)[https://fontforge.org/en-US/] to create the font as best I can.

Elian Script is a writing system that promotes creativity when drawing it's characters. It's very quick to pick up and (it's website)[https://www.ccelian.com/concepca.html] provides a quick rundown on how it works. It's basically reading a tic-tac-toe board.

Only the standard latin alphabet is included at the moment, along with numbers 1-9 and commonly used glyphs like "%", "@", and "&". It should be enough for most tasks.
